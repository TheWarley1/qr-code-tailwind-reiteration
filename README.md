# qr-code-tailwind-reiteration

took me a long time to figure the installation, spent a long time trying to figure how to use it to get what i need.
for my next trick, i shall go on to apply tailwind to the clipboard landing page project.

update!
an hour later

I lied, after realizing i didnt set mobile view, i embarked on that then i was confused for some time, realised if i sset mobile media quries, i have to set for large as well.

i have decide to take on small projects instead till i'm good enough
